I'll draft a GitHub README file for your first ML model training project. First, let me quickly analyze the contents of your uploaded Jupyter Notebook to tailor the README accordingly.

Based on your notebook contents, here’s a README file tailored for your first ML model training project:

### Project Summary:
The project involves training and evaluating two regression models (Linear Regression and Random Forest) to predict solubility (`logS`) based on molecular descriptors.

### Sample README:

# Machine Learning Model: Solubility Prediction

This repository contains the code for training and evaluating machine learning models to predict solubility (`logS`) of molecules using molecular descriptor data.

## Features
- **Data Loading**: Load the dataset from a public URL.
- **Data Preparation**: Split data into features (X) and target (Y).
- **Model Training**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score.
- **Visualization**: Scatter plots of predicted vs. actual values for model performance.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from [Delaney's solubility dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dataprofessor/data/master/delaney_solubility_with_descriptors.csv), which contains molecular descriptors and solubility values.

## Workflow
1. **Data Splitting**:
   - Splits the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets using `train_test_split`.
2. **Model Training**:
   - Trains a **Linear Regression** model.
   - Trains a **Random Forest** model with a maximum depth of 2 for simplicity.
3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluates training and testing performance using:
     - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
     - R² Score
   - Compares both models.
4. **Visualization**:
   - Scatter plots for observed vs. predicted values.

## Requirements
Install the required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abhii039/ml-solubility-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd ml-solubility-prediction
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook first_project.ipynb
   ```
4. Execute the cells to load data, train models, and visualize results.

## Results
The project compares two regression models:
| Model             | Training MSE | Training R² | Test MSE | Test R² |
|-------------------|--------------|-------------|----------|---------|
| Linear Regression | ...          | ...         | ...      | ...     |
| Random Forest     | ...          | ...         | ...      | ...     |

## Visualizations
Scatter plots showcasing predicted vs. actual values are generated to visualize model performance.
